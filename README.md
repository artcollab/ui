## Draw Dojo ![](public/logo2.png)

This repository was created for the purpose of collaborating on and creating the 'Draw Dojo' art platform as part of Team 13's 3rd Year Heriot-Watt F29SO/F29PD
Group Project. The system is intended to be used by the general population, particularly those interested in the production of artwork in a full collaborative environment.
The system acts as a creative social media platform, allowing its users to express and share their artistic talents amongst friends and followers.

The system is composed of a Web Application which uses multiple backend frameworks to allow users to build and publish artwork either as a single person or as part of a group.
The system stores basic user information in a database to construct their own personalized user profile, along with each of their art pieces.

## Key Features

Users can create accounts and customise their profile.
Users can draw their own art pieces, or collaborate / add on to other works to create their own unique drawings.
Users can upload these drawings to a public space for other people to view.
Users can Like and Comment on posts, as well as follow creators, making their content more available to the user.
The platform works consistenly across all major browsers.


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
